## Nvim Post-installation Notes

Check Health (always useful on a fresh install)

```sh
:checkhealth

```

Fix copy/paste issues

- on macOS, `pbcopy` is installed by default

- on Arch

```sh
sudo pacman -S xsel

```

Install python support

```sh
sudo pacman -S python-pynvim

```

Install node support
(assuming npm is installed)

```sh
npm i -g neovim

```
